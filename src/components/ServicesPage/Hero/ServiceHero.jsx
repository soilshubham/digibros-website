                            Digital Marketing is not an art of selling a product. It is an art of making people buy the
                            product that you sell. Strategic approach to this is through Search engine marketing
                            (SEM) which is a form of Internet marketing that involves the promotion of websites by
                            increasing their visibility in search engine results pages primarily through paid
                            advertising.

                            each tell 6 friends. If you make customers happy on the Internet, they can each tell 6,000
                            friends.”
