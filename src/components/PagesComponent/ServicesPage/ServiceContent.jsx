                            which is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website

                            Digital Marketing is not an art of selling a product. It is an art of making people buy the
                            product that you sell. Strategic approach to this is through Search engine marketing
                            (SEM) which is a form of Internet marketing that involves the promotion of websites by
                            increasing their visibility in search engine results pages primarily through paid
                            advertising.

                            Social media marketing is the use of social media platforms and websites to promote a

                            Social media marketing is about sociology and psychology more than technology. As
                            quoted by Jeff Bezos “If you make customers happy in the physical world, they might
                            each tell 6 friends. If you make customers happy on the Internet, they can each tell 6,000
                            friends.”

                            Content marketing is a form of marketing focused on creating, publishing, and
                            distributing content for a targeted audience online. Every digital marketing expert says
                            that “Content Is King''. Because all the techniques we have mentioned need content.
                            Whether it's SEO, SMM, SEM, Email Marketing, etc., will not work without content.
                            That’s the importance of content marketing services.
